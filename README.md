# Project Title: OpenMRS Application - User Stories README

## Overview
This README provides an overview of the user stories implemented for the OpenMRS application. The user stories cover various functionalities ranging from user authentication to patient management. This project utilizes Java programming language along with TestNG for testing and Logger for logging purposes.

## User Stories Implemented
### US_401: Checking Login Errors in the System
- Ensures warning messages are displayed for incorrect login attempts.
- Includes acceptance criteria for navigating, entering invalid credentials, and receiving appropriate warnings.

### US_402: Perform Login in the System
- Enables users to log into the system with valid credentials.
- Specifies the steps required for successful login.

### US_403: Perform Logout from the System
- Allows users to securely log out of the system.
- Describes the process for logging out and its confirmation.

### US_404: Patient Registration
- Enables users to register patients into the system.
- Outlines the steps for registering a patient and verifying the registration.

### US_405: My Account
- Provides users with access to their account settings.
- Describes how users can access and interact with their account settings.

### US_406: Patient Search in Patient List
- Facilitates doctors in searching for patients within the system.
- Includes criteria for searching, accessing patient information, and handling non-existent patient records.

### US_407: Patient Deletion
- Allows doctors to delete patient records from the system securely.
- Specifies steps for finding, accessing, and deleting patient records.

### US_408: Patient Listing
- Provides a feature for listing all patients in the system.
- Verifies the accuracy of patient listing displayed.

### US_409: Patient Record Merge
- Allows doctors to merge patient records for efficient management.
- Details the process of merging patient records and handling warnings.

### US_410: Incorrect System (Local Computer) Timezone during Appointment Booking
- Notifies users of an error if the system timezone is incorrect for appointment scheduling.
- Specifies steps for triggering the error message and verifying its appearance.

## Test and Logging
- **Java**: The project is implemented in Java programming language.
- **TestNG**: TestNG framework is utilized for testing functionalities.
- **Logger**: Logger is employed for logging purposes throughout the project.

## Running the Tests
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Set up TestNG and Logger dependencies in your project.
3. Run the test suites associated with each user story using TestNG.
4. Check the logs generated by Logger for any debugging or informational messages.
